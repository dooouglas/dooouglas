# 👋 Hey, I'm Douglas, let me introduce myself...

I am currently transitioning careers, following my passion for the field of Technology. With a degree in Advertising and Marketing from São Judas Tadeu University, I recently completed the TripleTen Bootcamp, specializing as a QA (Quality Assurance) Analyst. Now, I am deepening my knowledge in test automation, fully committed to continuous learning within the QA universe.

- 📚 I’m currently learning Cypress, CSS3, Angular 9, Ajax, Postgres, ESNext, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Gulp and Webpack. I know, a lot, but I like it haha.
- 💬 Ask me about test methods.

- ⚡ Fun fact? Well, after seven years in the healthcare field, I decided to embrace my passion for technology, and the more I learn about QA, the more I realize I’ve finally found my place.
